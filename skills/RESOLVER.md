# GBrain Skill Resolver

This is the dispatcher. Skills are the implementation. **Read the skill file before acting.** If two skills could match, read both. They are designed to chain (e.g., ingest then enrich for each entity).

## Always-on (every message)

## Namespace routing (brain filing by type)

|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| ideas/ | Business and technical ideas with pipeline frontmatter | idea-triage (evaluation), idea-ingest (intake) |

## GStack Review Personas (native subagents via PR #4220)

| Trigger | Command | Focus |
|---------|---------|-------|
| "Review this strategically", "CEO review", "strategic fit" | /ceo-review | Strategic fit, user value, market timing |
| "Architecture review", "tech debt", "eng review" | /eng-review | Architecture, tech debt, maintainability |

| "List personas", "gstack" | /gstack | Show all available personas |

> These are native Hermes subagents (not external GStack dependency).
> Each persona spawns an isolated child agent with specialized system prompt.
> For business idea triage, /ceo-review is directly applicable.

## GStack Thinking Skills (original)

| Agent needs user context | Read `USER.md` |

## Disambiguation rules

When multiple skills could match:
1. Prefer the most specific skill (meeting-ingestion over ingest)
2. If the user mentions a URL, route by content type (link → idea-ingest, video → media-ingest)
3. If the user mentions a person/company, check if enrich or query fits better
4. Chaining is explicit in each skill's Phases section
5. When in doubt, ask the user

## Conventions (cross-cutting)

These apply to ALL brain-writing skills:
- `skills/conventions/quality.md` — citations, back-links, notability gate
- `skills/conventions/brain-first.md` — check brain before external APIs
- `skills/conventions/brain-routing.md` — which brain (DB) and which source (repo) to target; cross-brain federation is latent-space only
- `skills/conventions/schema-evolution.md` — when to add a type vs alias vs prefix (read before `schema-author`)
- `skills/conventions/subagent-routing.md` — when to use Minions vs inline work
- `skills/_brain-filing-rules.md` — where files go
- `skills/_output-rules.md` — output quality standards
